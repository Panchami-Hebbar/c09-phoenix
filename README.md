# College Management System

A College Management System (CMS) is like a digital helper for colleges. It keeps track of student details, class schedules, grades, and more. It helps teachers, students, and staff by making things like attendance, exams, and communication easier. It's like a one-stop shop for managing all the important stuff in a school, but online!
